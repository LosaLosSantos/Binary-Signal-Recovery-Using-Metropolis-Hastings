# Binary-Signal-Recovery-Using-Metropolis-Hastings
This repository contains a project to recover a binary signal from noisy data using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It includes functions to generate data, calculate the likelihood, and run the MCMC algorithm. The main script computes and plots the mean squared error for different measurements.
